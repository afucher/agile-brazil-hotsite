We are pleased to announce that the WBMA proceedings will be published in the Communications in Computer and Information Science (CCIS) book series, a Springer Publication. (acrescentar o logo em anexo em algum lugar apropriado). We suggest that you check out previous proceedings of WBMA on SpringerLink, [https://link.springer.com/conference/wbma](https://link.springer.com/conference/wbma). 

Authors should consult Springer’s authors’ guidelines and use their proceedings templates, either for LaTeX or for Word, for the preparation of their papers. Springer encourages authors to include their ORCIDs in their papers. In addition, the corresponding author of each paper, acting on behalf of all of the authors of that paper, must complete and sign a Consent-to-Publish form. The corresponding author signing the copyright form should match the corresponding author marked on the paper. Once the files have been sent to Springer, changes relating to the authorship of the papers cannot be made.


We recommend that you announce publication of the proceedings in CCIS on your conference website and include the pertinent logo, which can also be downloaded from the bottom of the editors’ page. You may also like to link to previous WBMA 2019 proceedings on SpringerLink, [https://link.springer.com/conference/wbma](https://link.springer.com/conference/wbma), from your website. The book metrics available on SpringerLink give details on the number of citations, downloads, and readers at paper level and at book level.

We ask you to include the following text on your website and in your Call for Papers: “Authors should consult Springer’s authors’ guidelines and use their proceedings templates, either for LaTeX or for Word, for the preparation of their papers. Springer encourages authors to include their ORCIDs in their papers. In addition, the corresponding author of each paper, acting on behalf of all of the authors of that paper, must complete and sign a Consent-to-Publish form. The corresponding author signing the copyright form should match the corresponding author marked on the paper. Once the files have been sent to Springer, changes relating to the authorship of the papers cannot be made.” The appropriate links should be made available to the authors.
