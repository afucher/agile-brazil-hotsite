# Belo Horizonte/MG, Brazil, Setember 11 - 13, 2019


WBMA 2019 will be co-located with the Agile Brazil'2019 [Agile Brazil 2019](https://www.agilebrazil.com/2019/) in Belo Horizonte in Brazil.

**WBMA** The 10th Brazilian Workshop on Agile Methods (WBMA’2019) is the research track in the Agile Brazil conference.
 WBMA is an academic event that focuses on agile software development. This year’s edition comes with 
 a history of success. Our past editions received an expressive number of paper submissions. They also 
 featured a number of attendees (students, researchers, and practitioners) from different countries.
  We hope to repeat this success this year and influence even more the integration between industry 
  and academia. We believe this integration can create ideas, opportunities and innovations for all 
  involved.


Last year, the Agile Brazil conference has received more than 500 attendees from all over the world.
This year, our expectation is that the workshop will receive even more researchers,
students, and practitioners from Brazil and abroad. This year, WBMA’2019 will be held on October,
11 - 13, in Belo Horizonte/MG - Brazil. The workshop will be included in the Agile Brazil schedule.
