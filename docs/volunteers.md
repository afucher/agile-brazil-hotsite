If you are a lively person who likes to work as a team, the Agile Brazil 2019 volunteer program is a great opportunity for you to help the conference by putting Agile into practice and innovating in different ways!

We are looking for people who are energetic and strongly committed to being part of a diverse team, willing to share knowledge and evolve progressively while attending the conference.
Interested? Carefully read the volunteer program information below, in the FAQ prepared by volunteers themselves from previous years and veterans of this year's volunteer team.

## FAQ

### Who we are looking for?

If you are engaged in the agile community (or want to be!), and want to be part of a very agile team at the event, and also want to make Agile Brazil happen, you can be a volunteer, in the 2019 edition.

### What do volunteers do?

The volunteer's main job is to make the event run smoothly. To do so, you will assist in the reception of conference attendees, monitoring rooms, gathering feedback from the sessions, assisting speakers, and supporting the event as a whole.

### How many hours / days do the volunteers need to be available?

The day before the event starts, volunteers will be introduced and will participate in a training session and assembly of swag bags.
An important feature of the Volunteer Team is the ability to self-organize. It will be needed, for example, to assemble the team's work scale, and to think of smart ways of accomplishing the tasks.
In addition to the fixed schedule, some small meetings are scheduled before and after each event day.
Until the event starts, we attend some virtual meetings to start getting to know each other, and make some decisions about Agile Brazil.

### And which are the benefits?

Volunteering is one of the richest ways to attend a conference, as well as a means of providing access to the event to those who could not otherwise come. In exchange for your effort and work, you will have access to the 3-day conference and opportunities for more interaction with speakers and participants.

### When I will know if I was selected?

The dates of the volunteer program are:
- 06/17: Opening of registrations;
- 06/24: Closing of registrations;
- 07/01: Notice of approved volunteers;
- 07/08: Deadline for confirmation of selected.
